# SPI-I2C-INTERFACING
I²C with 8051 – Demonstrates Inter-Integrated Circuit communication for connecting multiple devices using just two wires (SDA, SCL) for data exchange between the 8051 and peripherals.  SPI with 8051 – Shows Serial Peripheral Interface communication using MOSI, MISO, SCK, and CS pins for fast data transfer between the 8051 and external devices.
The Folders:
  8051@8extra2:A project which tell us about I2C using a DS1307 RTC module!
  8051@8extra3:A simple stuff which prints on the serial monitor repeatedly from any memory device to monitor
  8051@8extra4:An exact SPI used interfacing example of EEPROM (24LC256) and read it back
